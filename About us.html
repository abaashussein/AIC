    Arrahma Masjid was first established in 2004 to cater for the needs of the thriving Muslim population in the city of Birmingham and continues to be one of Birmingham’s largest mosques to date. Located within easy access to the city of Birmingham, the Masjid aspires not only to provide facilities to perform the five daily prayers, but also to uplift the ummah and cater to be an educational and spiritual hub for the growing Muslim community.

Since its inception in 2004 the Masjid has undoubtedly become an invaluable centre of worship and plays an important role in providing both prayer facilities and educational classes. In addition Arrahma Masjid currently holds classes on Qur’an, Islamic sciences and Arabic language and has also held many Islamic conferences and seminars promoting interfaith dialogue within the community.

Other activities based at Arrahma Masjid include youth recreational activities, matrimonial services and family counselling services to cater for the growing needs of the Muslim society. Arrahma Masjid has the capacity to accommodate a large number of worshipers and currently has accommodated over 6000 worshippers during the Eid congregational prayers.
